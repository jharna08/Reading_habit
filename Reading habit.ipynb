    "Now I want to know why females read more. Reading frequency is influenced by employment type, retirement, and part-time vs full work. If more women in the datasets are retired or part-time employed, they may have more discretionary time for reading. \n",
    "1) Checked Employment Status gender wise: From the result, it can be seen that the number of women employed without pay is more than that of men, more than double. Also, among retired readers, females are more than males. In the part time as well as full-time employment, females are in larger numbers than males. These groups have more flexible schedules, typically, and are more likely to engage in leisure activities like reading. "
